<p> Good decision making and implementation is hard. 70% of major projects fail to finish on time or on budget. We think we can do better.<p>

<p> From noticing a problem or opportunity, deliberating about a solution, and implementing your decision problems occur.<p>

<p> We can't avoid bad decisions. But we can use tools that make it more likely we will make good decisions. <p>

<p> We're a group of behavioural scientists and economists interested in the tools that help better decision making. On this site, you will find access to early versions of tools we create as well as those we like to use. We would love you to use these and give us <a href="mailto:robtilleard@gmail.com">feedback.</a> <p>

<p> If you want to hear more about our tools as we release them and tag along for our beta journey - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-tilleard/">get in contact</a>.<p>
